# About
[balena-engine](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine) does not release statically linked binaries anymore ([look](https://github.com/balena-os/balena-engine/issues/111#issuecomment-1437440469)) so we use this repository to build those so we can use them as replacement for [system-docker](https://github.com/burmilla/os-system-docker)
